Canard Question Module Editor
======

Canard is a [what-you-see-is-what-you-mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYM) editor that allows a questionnaire designer to describe their intent behind a data collection instrument, but also allows them to see a real-time live example of what that specification may look like when presented to a respondent.

Canard also acts a a prototype tool for illustrating (and testing) the principles of Structured Questionnaire Design, using the [Simple Questionnaire Building Language](http://sqbl.org) as its management format. By using the cutdown SQBL format, Canard remains agile requiring netowkr connectivity only forwhen connecting modules together, but allowing an entire question module to be captured withina single document.

A series of [tutorial videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijk00SqoBGk&list=PLAAYNfaBiVMNap5kCJ1le62oDdLNDiNnk) are available on youtube showing how to use the software.
